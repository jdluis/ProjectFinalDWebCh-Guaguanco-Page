 Description:
This is a personal project that also serves as a final project for the Web Development course at CoderHouse.com.

The project consists of the creation of a multipage website to promote a festival called Guaguanco Festival 2022, of which I have been an official promoter for 3 years.

In it I offer my services, in addition to being a promoter for the sale of the fullpass with its respective discount,
the help and support for different stages of the festival, from the flight to the Hotel and its surroundings.
